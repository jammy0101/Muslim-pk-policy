You may enable or disable location access at any time through your device settings.

Muslim PK uses Firebase services such as Firestore to store and retrieve application content (for example, wallpapers or Islamic resources).
The app does not use Firebase Analytics to track user behavior.
The app does not create personal user profiles.
No personal user data is stored on external servers at this time.

If any cached or locally stored data exists on your device, you can remove it at any time by clearing the app data or uninstalling the application.
Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data using trusted services and secure APIs.
However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

The app does not require account creation.
The app does not knowingly collect or store personal information from children.
If account-based features are introduced in the future, they will comply with applicable child data protection and privacy laws. All content is designed to be safe and family-friendly.
